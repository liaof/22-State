### Lesson Goal
- Use the React Context API to implement a Redux-like store to manage state globally.
- Write Redux-like actions and reducers with the necessary tests in place.

##### Tech Used
- Stripe - a suite of payment processing APIs
- Stripe.js - Stripe’s JavaScript library for building payment flows. It uses Stripe Elements, a set of prebuilt, customizable UI components to allow platforms to collect sensitive payment information.(For the purposes of this module's application, you’ll use the @stripe/stripe-js (Links to an external site.) npm package to redirect your app to a prebuilt Stripe checkout page.)
